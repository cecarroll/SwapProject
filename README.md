/***
constant MAX is max length of array
function sort (array):
    create integer variables i and j
    for i from zero to MAX - 1:
        for j from zero to MAX - 1:
            if array[j] > array[j+1]:
                swap array[j] with array[j+1]
                printArray(array)



Here, I am taking in 2 pointers to addresses of the values of array:
    I can change each pointer to change the value at their addresses. If I change one pointer*, I change teh value at the address&.
    If I change the pointer, it doesnt change the value at the &address. If I make arrayi = arrayj&, then I can still make arrayi& = arrayj


function swap (array[i], array[j]):
I was researching a lot if there was a way to do this without a temp variable, but alas
int temp
temp equals a 
a equals b
b equals temp *remember we will have to assign pointers that go back to the address to get the desired changes



function printValues(array):
    for i from zero to MAX - 1: 
        printf(array[i])







function sort(array)
while keepGoing = True{
    keepGoing = False
    for i in max-1
        if array[i] > array[i+1]
            swap[array[i], array[i+1]]
            keepGoing = True
}
